TO DO
    Fix turn speed scaling.
        scaling is *way* too fast. maybe some exponential growth near the edges of the screen. so that a quick dart to the side is a fast turn, gives more control for small turns.  
    make circle scale with window size. 
        exactly what it says on the tin. circle is only a set number of pixels atm, it should be based on how big the window is so that the area accesible from within the circle stays the same.
    fix melee combat aiming.  
        Does not work whatsoever, hitting enemies feels nearly impossible and inconsistent.
    Fix ranged combat aiming. 
        Arrow still aims as if the cursor is still in the center of the screen. 
    fix mouse-movement based turn speed.
        moving the mouse seems to speed up the turn movement.  
    Third person mouse visibility
        mouse disappears when in third person
    in game settings menu 
        Adjustable circle size. 
        different turn scaling settings. (maybe even custom ones if we got really spicy with it?)
